This installation script currently is quite specific in the setup for the parititions. This aims to 
be fixed by allowing users to specify in the config file the SWAP, EFI, ROOT, ETC partitions.

/dev/sda1 = EFI Partition
/dev/sda2 = SWAP Partition 
/dev/sda3 = ROOT Partition

/dev/sda1 = EFI Partition 
/dev/sda2 = BOOT Partition

/dev/sda1 = SWAP Partition 
/dev/sda2 = ROOT Partition 

BIOS ENCRYPTED: 

/dev/sda1 = BOOT Partition 
/dev/sda2 = ROOT Partition
